Absolutely, Mohamad. Here’s a curated list of essential Docker commands tailored for a DevSecOps engineer working in a DevOps ecosystem. These focus on container lifecycle management, image security, and integration into CI/CD workflows—with an emphasis on clarity and real-world utility.

## 📦 Image Management

- **Pull trusted base image**
  ```bash
  docker pull ubuntu:20.04
  ```
- **Build secure image from Dockerfile**
  ```bash
  docker build -t secure-app:latest .
  ```
- **Tag for version control or registry push**
  ```bash
  docker tag secure-app:latest registry.example.com/devsecops/secure-app:v1.0.0
  ```
- **Push to private registry**
  ```bash
  docker push registry.example.com/devsecops/secure-app:v1.0.0
  ```

---

## 🔐 Security Checks

- **Scan image for vulnerabilities (Trivy)**
  ```bash
  trivy image secure-app:latest
  ```
- **Audit running container for package risks**
  ```bash
  trivy fs /var/lib/docker/overlay2/<container_id>/
  ```
- **Check Dockerfile for misconfigurations (Hadolint)**
  ```bash
  hadolint Dockerfile
  ```

---

## 📁 Container Operations

- **Run container interactively**
  ```bash
  docker run -it --name devsecops-app secure-app:latest /bin/bash
  ```
- **Start/stop container**
  ```bash
  docker start devsecops-app
  docker stop devsecops-app
  ```
- **Remove container/image**
  ```bash
  docker rm devsecops-app
  docker rmi secure-app:latest
  ```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

- **View real-time logs**
  ```bash
  docker logs -f devsecops-app
  ```
- **Inspect metadata**
  ```bash
  docker inspect devsecops-app
  ```
- **Check resource usage**
  ```bash
  docker stats devsecops-app
  ```

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration Snippets

- **Use Docker in GitHub Actions**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    docker-build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Build Docker image
          run: docker build -t secure-app .
  ```

- **Clean up dangling images to reduce attack surface**
  ```bash
  docker image prune -f
  ```

---

## 🧼 Hardening Best Practices

- Use non-root user inside container
- Set `HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile
- Avoid exposing sensitive ports by default
- Minimize use of `ADD`; prefer `COPY`
```

If you want, I can tailor this for a specific platform like GitLab CI, Jenkins, or even integrate advanced runtime security tools like Falco or Sysdig. Just say the word 🚀
